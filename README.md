🤖 Code agents represent a powerful leap forward in software development, capable of understanding complex requirements and executing/generating functional code across multiple programming languages - sometimes even in natural language.


⚠️ But code agents are not risk-free.

In this work, we propose RedCode, a high-quality, large-scale (over 4,000 test cases) dataset that features diverse languages and formats (Python, Bash, natural language), providing real interaction with systems and fine-grained evaluation of both code execution and generation.

**RedCode** consists of RedCode-Exec and RedCode-Gen.
- **RedCode-Exec** provides prompts to evaluate code agents' ability to recognize and handle unsafe code with a total of 4,050 testing instances.
- **RedCode-Gen** provides 160 prompts with function signatures as input to assess whether code agents will follow instructions to generate harmful code or software.

We present the following 5 new findings (Finding 1-5) from our evaluations, which have not been revealed in prior benchmarks:

- **Finding 1: OpenCodeInterpreter is safer than ReAct and CodeAct agents.**

- **Finding 2: Agents are more likely to reject executing unsafe operations in operating system domain.**

- **Finding 3: Agents are less likely to reject risky queries in natural language than programming language inputs, or in Bash code than Python code inputs.**

- **Finding 4: More capable base models, such as GPT series, tend to have a higher rejection rate for unsafe operations under the same Agent structure.**

- **Finding 5: More capable base models tend to produce more sophisticated and effective harmful software.**

## 📂 Repository Structure

### Dataset

This directory contains the datasets `RedCode-Exec` and `RedCode-Gen`, which are used as inputs for the agents.

### Environment

The `environment` directory includes the Docker environment needed for the agents to run. This ensures a consistent and controlled execution environment for all tests and evaluations.

### Evaluation

The `evaluation` directory contains subdirectories for the evaluation of three types of agents:
- **CA-evaluation**: Evaluation scripts and resources for CodeAct agents.
- **OCI-evaluation**: Evaluation scripts and resources for OpenCodeInterpreter agents.
- **RA-evaluation**: Evaluation scripts and resources for ReAct agents.

Additionally, `evaluation.py` that serve as evaluation scripts for each risky scenario.

### Result

The `result` directory stores the results of the evaluations.

### Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains the bash scripts to run the evaluations for OCI, RA, and CA agents.

## 🎯 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Installation

Clone this GitHub repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-secure/RedCode.git
```

### Environment Setup

The `environment.yml` file lists all dependencies required for the project. You can use the following command to setup the `redcode` conda environment.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate redcode
```

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/OCI_eval.sh
./scripts/RA_eval.sh
./scripts/CA_eval.sh
```

Currently, the scripts are run separately. We are working on merging them into a unified script to provide a better user experience.
